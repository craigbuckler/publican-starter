Static Site Generators won't solve all your problems, but they can simplify and streamline website production.


## User benefits

Users won't know they're viewing a static site, but they may notice:

1. Better performance. The site will load faster because it's pre-rendered. There's no runtime build process so the server need only return files.
1. Less downtime. A static site is less likely to fail because there are fewer dependencies such as server-side languages or databases.


## Site owner benefits

Site owners and developers also gain from SSGs.

1. Fewer constraints. You're not tied to a specific CMS and can implement whatever functionality you require.
1. Improved resilience. It's easier to back-up or source control files and, if you're using a CMS, it need not be accessible from the internet.
1. Better security. There is little software to *hack*. The worst someone could do is access your web server and change content -- but you could re-render it within minutes.
1. Lower costs. Static sites are cheaper to host and scale.

Of course, there are [SSG downsides&hellip;](--ROOT--post/ssg-bad-parts/)
